# python-autopxd2
A friendly fork of autopxd https://github.com/tarruda/python-autopxd

This repo isn't usable for now but will be soon.
It will allow to generate `.pxd` files automatically from `.h` files.

Roadmap:

- Refactoring of the code
- Adding tests for PEP8
- Adding tests for the command line
- Uploading to PyPi
- Check that the generated code is correct by comparing it to the libc in Cython
- More tests
- Merge it into Cython so that the `.pxd` files aren't necessary anymore? Maybe.


#### Please raise an issue if the generated code isn't correct.

It's difficult to catch all the corner cases.
